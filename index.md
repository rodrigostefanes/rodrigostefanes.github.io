  <h1>Hello there!</h1>

  <p>My name is <strong>Rodrigo Stefanes</strong>. I am currently completing my bachelors study in mathematics at <a href="https://ufsc.br">Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)</a> in Brazil.</p>

  <p>My main interests are in <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>

## Research

### Formal Methods
My main research interest is automated program verification. Currently, I am working on the validation of program verification tools.

### Mathematical Logic
I am also interested in Model Theory. In this area, I have recently submitted a paper regarding the model-theoretical aspects of modal logics:

* **Intrinsic and relative characterization results for logics with negative modalities**
  * *Jim de Groot, João Marcos, Rodrigo Stefanes*
  * Submitted (December 2025). Available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15496).

### Computer Science Projects
I also enjoy contributing to general Computer Science projects. Specifically, I have been working on **ranking and unranking algorithms**.
